# creating your own function

def my_function():
    print("Hello")
    print("By")

my_function()

# while loops
num = 3
while num > 0:
    print("Keep going")
    num -= 1

# most projects today were done on a different site so here are some notes:

""" def allows you to group a list of commands as one function and can save lines of code and make it more readable
by just calling the one function instead of needing to rewrite each step each time
    while loops act similarly to for loops except they may not have a defined ending lkike a for loop would
    these can be more risky because in some scenarios there is no ending ex: while 5 > 3: 5 is always greter than 3 so this
    loop will go on forever"""
